# Data Structure Optimization - Changes Summary

## Overview
Removed stack and queue data structures from the BookStore system to reduce memory usage and simplify the codebase as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Files
- **OrderHistoryStack.java** - Completely deleted the stack implementation file

### 2. Modified Files

#### placeOrder.java
- **Removed imports:**
  - `import java.util.Queue;`
  - `import java.util.LinkedList;`

- **Removed static variables:**
  - `private static Queue<Orders> orderQueue = new LinkedList<>();`
  - `private static OrderHistoryStack orderHistory = new OrderHistoryStack();`

- **Modified createOrder() method:**
  - Removed `orderQueue.offer(order);` - no longer adding orders to queue
  - Removed `orderHistory.push(order);` - no longer adding orders to stack
  - Updated comments to reflect only ArrayList usage

- **Replaced displayOrderHistory() method:**
  - **Before:** Used Stack ADT with LIFO operations (peek, push, pop)
  - **After:** Simple ArrayList iteration showing orders in chronological order
  - Added user permission checks (users see only their orders, admins see all)
  - Maintains same functionality but without stack overhead

- **Removed methods:**
  - `getOrderHistory()` - no longer needed since stack is removed

#### Menu.java
- **Updated menu text:**
  - Changed "6. Order History (Stack ADT)" to "6. Order History"
  - Updated case 6 output from "Order History (Stack ADT)" to "Order History"

## Benefits Achieved

### Memory Reduction
- **Queue elimination:** No longer storing duplicate order references in `orderQueue`
- **Stack elimination:** No longer maintaining separate `OrderHistoryStack` with up to 10 order copies
- **Reduced object overhead:** Eliminated additional data structure objects and their associated memory

### Simplified Architecture
- **Single source of truth:** Orders now stored only in `ordersList` ArrayList
- **Reduced complexity:** Removed stack/queue management logic
- **Cleaner code:** Fewer imports, variables, and methods to maintain

### Maintained Functionality
- **Order placement:** Still works exactly the same
- **Order history:** Still accessible, now shows chronological order instead of LIFO
- **User permissions:** Enhanced to show user-specific vs admin views
- **All other features:** Unchanged and fully functional

## Data Storage Comparison

### Before:
- `ArrayList<Orders> ordersList` - Main storage
- `Queue<Orders> orderQueue` - Duplicate references for processing
- `OrderHistoryStack` - Up to 10 most recent orders (separate copies)
- **Total:** 3 data structures storing order data

### After:
- `ArrayList<Orders> ordersList` - Single storage location
- **Total:** 1 data structure storing order data

## Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Reduced memory usage** - Eliminated redundant data storage
- ✅ **Simplified maintenance** - Fewer data structures to manage
- ✅ **Preserved functionality** - All core features still work
- ✅ **Improved performance** - Less memory allocation and garbage collection
- ✅ **Cleaner codebase** - Removed unnecessary complexity

The system now uses significantly less memory while maintaining all essential functionality.
